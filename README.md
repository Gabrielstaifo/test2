# Introduction

Continuous integration is a software development technique that involves regularly merging code changes into a shared repository. The integration process is automatically checked by a continuous integration server, which performs an automated build and test. The outcome of this process is then sent to relevant users by the server.

## Gradle commands

-   `gradle build`: This command will build the project and create the executable files.
-   `gradle run`: This command will run the project.
-   `gradle test`: This command will run all the tests defined in the project.
-   `gradle clean`: This command will delete all the build files generated by previous builds.

## Run The project

Lorem Ipsum  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.


## Compilation has been implemented and unit-tested

## Cloning

The repo is cloned using JGit. The URI and branch is specified in the method. To test this, 2 tests are made to test the correct response is made when an invalid URL respectively branch is given as parameters. Also one test when a successful clone is made which finds a txt file in the test repo and makes sure a code string located in the test repo is found.

## Building

The build functions get a path for the repo that will be built using Gradle. The function creates an object that specifies the command to run for the corresponding operative system. Then another object is used to start a new process, which runs the specified command. Finally, the method returns the object which includes whether the build succeeded or not.

## Notification

Notification has been implemented using javax.mail. A group gmail was created which the server sends the mails from, and is hard-coded to send to one member of the group.

The mail contains the results from the build: Either that the compilation and testing was successful, or that the compilation or the testing was unsuccessful and in that case information about what went wrong.

## Contributions

- Ahmet Oguz:
- Anton Ärnbäck: Implemented the cloning feature and all the corresponding methods and tests. This feature clones the GitHub repo from a remote URI. Also worked on the delete method with Oguz. General refactoring and the initial experiments with ngrok.
- Carin Bystam:
- Gabriel Staifo: Implemented a function that build a cloned repo. The functions builds a Gradle project and returns an object contains information about the build. So if the build was succeeded the object will sets to “SUCCESSFUL” otherwise it will be “FAILURE”. Two tests for this function were implemented, one for success and one for failure.

The number of fixed issues for each member of the group:
|         Name     |Issue number                     |
